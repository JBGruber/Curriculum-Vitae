My main interest remains in protest movements and their significance for
political discourse in representative democracies. This topic is closely
connected to my interest in media discourse as well as representation of
dissent and demonstrations in the media. Beyond this, I am interested in
the technological advances in the field of machine learning and
automated text analysis—and more broadly in Computational Social
Science—which can substantially enhance my own media research.
